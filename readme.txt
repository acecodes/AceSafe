This is the script I built (out of the carcass of my horrendously unfashionable batch file system). The primary purpose of this program is to send files I value the most to my various backup sources. The script starts by reading a JSON file of paths. These paths are folders of files I want to backup. Then each path is turned into an class object and customized so that their files can be manipulated with copying methods. That's all it does for the moment, but I'll be adding new features as I see fit.
